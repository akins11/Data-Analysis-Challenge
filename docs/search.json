    "text": "One important step in data analysis that can not be overlooked is data cleaning, this ensure that the data is error free, complete, accurate and consistent by identifying and handling missing data, correcting or removing invalid and inconsistent records across the dataset. In doing this you will not only ensure that any insights or decisions made from the data are accurate and reliable, but also improve data storage by reducing the amount of unnecessary or redundant data, which can save storage space and improve processing times.\nIn this tutorial, we will be working with the FIFA-2021 data of different players around the world. This dataset contains information that can help us gain several insights about the demographics and attributes of professional football players However, like many other real-world datasets, it is messy and contains errors, inconsistencies, and missing data. Today we will clean and prepare the data for future analysis using several data cleaning techniques."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe primary goal of data cleaning is to improve the quality and accuracy of the data so that it can be useful for analysis and decision-making. Data cleaning is also a critical step in the data analysis/science process and cannot be ignored or overlooked when working with data. With the data cleaned, we can proceed into data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, etc."
